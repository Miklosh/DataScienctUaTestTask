# Data Scienct test project. 

A great place to start examining this project is from GameService#initGameField, this method is supposed to be called to start a game.
I've tried my best to comment every possible quastionable piece of code so fill free to read through and ask questions.
In order to test logic there is a test section with two test classes to cover every logic that is written. 
Complex tests have comments section so you wont be lost in what is going on there.

It was interesting to coding this project hope you'll enjoy reading it :)
